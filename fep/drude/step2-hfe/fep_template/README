The calculation of the free energies of hydration is an automated process that consists in running two scripts: fep.run and xtract.run in the vac and water directories. The scripts in this example were directly adaped from the Drude protocol.

fep.run starts the required jobs using SGE. For other queueing system it needs to be adjusted. The path of the charmm executable needs to be written.

xtract.run determined the contributions to the FE from vacuum and solution. It follows the protocol used in the development of the Druide FF: the chardged part is done by TI and the repulsion/dispersion contribution by WHAM.

Run calc.run for final value. 

In the file parset.sr the user needs to adjust the following section:

 set  molecule   NMA     
 set  nwater     250 ! 0 - gas-phase; 250 - condensed-phase

 set  Drude      FALSE

 set toppardir   .
 set topparfile  @toppardir/toppar.str

 !! Number of steps for the equilibration run
 ! normal run requires 50000 steps
 set EqStepC 10000
 set EqStepA 10000
 set EqStepR 10000

 !! Number of steps for the production run
 ! normal run requires 100000 steps
 set ProdStepC 50000
 set ProdStepA 50000
 set ProdStepR 50000



In wham_anal.run the user needs to adjust the path of the charmm executable and the variable mtime corresponding to the number of production steps:

mtime=50000


The long range correction is calculated in LRC and the user has to run the charmm script run_box_md.inp followed by anal_box_md_lrc.inp. The results are in energy_lrc.txt

Notes on Corrections to ΔG of Charged Species

(from Justin)

1. There is a phase potential associated with an ion crossing the vacuum-water interface, equal to zFΦ, where z is the charge on the ion, F is the Faraday constant (23.06 kcal/mol-V), and Φ is the electrostatic Galvani potential at the vacuum-water interface. For SWM4-NDP, Φ = -545 mV (-0.545 V). So, as an example, for Mg2+, the total correction is (+2)(23.06)(-0.545) = -25.2 kcal/mol. The ΔG value obtained using the free energy scripts is an "intrinsic" ΔG and thus to obtain the "real" ΔG you need to add this correction:

ΔGreal = ΔGintrinsic + zFΦ

2. There is also an entropy correction that needs to be applied that reflects the compression of 1 mole of gaseous ions into 1 L in the aqueous phase (1 M concentration). This reflects a compression from an ideal gas state of 24.465 L/mol. The total correction is -RTln(1/24.465) = +1.9 kcal/mol. So, building off of the above equation:

ΔGreal = ΔGintrinsic + zFΦ - RTln(1/24.465) + LRC

i.e.

ΔGreal = ΔGintrinsic + zFΦ + 1.9 kcal/mol + LRC
